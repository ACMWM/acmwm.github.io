The Society of Women in Computing (SWC) is a recently established William & Mary
student chapter of the national Association for Computing Machinery's Committee
on Women in Computing (ACM-W), aimed at bridging the gender gap in tech.
We support, celebrate, and advocate for the full engagement of women in all
aspects of the computing field. Specifically for our chapter, we want to create
a central organization where women (and everyone) can network, foster
relationships and share their experiences in computing.
