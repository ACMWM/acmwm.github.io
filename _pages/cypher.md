<!-- Cypher is returning as a virtual hackathon this Spring, April 9-11! Work with your friends to make a cool hack involving topics such as Web/App development and Machine Learning while networking with tech recruiters. Register at <a href="http://cypher.cs.wm.edu">cypher.cs.wm.edu</a>. Those who registered last year will need to do so again. -->

If you want to be part of planning the hackathon for Spring 2022, join <a href="https://wmacm.slack.com/archives/C022HGWJSUW" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`#cyphervii-planning`</a> on our Slack.
