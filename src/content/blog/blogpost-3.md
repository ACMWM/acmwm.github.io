### Opportunities

Bytes of Knowledge: A Lunch & Learn Experience with Jefferson Lab
Are you curious about exciting career opportunities in the field of computer science?  Jefferson Lab invites you to a special Lunch and Learn session designed just for you!  You will discover diverse career pathways available, learn about our innovative research, and engage in Q&A with members of our J Lab team to help you succeed in your career.  We look forward to seeing you there!

This event will take place in McGlothlin-Street Hall, Room 020.

Scientists worldwide utilize the lab’s unique particle accelerator, known as the Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility (CEBAF), to probe the most basic building blocks of matter - helping us to better understand these particles and the forces that bind them - and ultimately our world.

In addition, the lab capitalizes on its unique technologies and expertise to perform advanced computing and applied research with industry and university partners, and provides programs designed to help educate the next generation in science and technology.
