### What is it?
"The International Collegiate Programming Contest is an algorithmic programming
contest for college students. Teams of three, representing their university,
work to solve the most real-world problems, fostering collaboration, creativity,
innovation, and the ability to perform under pressure. Through training and
competition, teams challenge each other to raise the bar on the possible. Quite 
simply, it is the oldest, largest, and most prestigious programming contest in
the world."
